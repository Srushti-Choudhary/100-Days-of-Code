Problem on Array Data Structure in Java:

Pascal's Triangle II:

Given a non-negative index 'rowIndex' , return the 'rowIndex'-th row of Pascal's triangle.

Pascal's trainagle is a traingular array of binomial coefficients. The k-th row of Pascal's triangle is constructed as follows:
1. The first and last elements in the row are always 1.
2. Each of the remaining elements is the sum of the numbers directly above-and-theleft and above-and-to-the-right.

Approach:
1. Use a single list to represent the current row.
2. Build the row by updating each element in reverse order.
3. Each element is the sum of the current element and the previous element in the row.
